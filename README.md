Language Overview
[Provide a brief description of your programming language - what it's designed for, its main characteristics]
This programming language is for high-class individuals who have low IQ, likes to hangout in starbs and borrows daddy's car.

Keywords
[List all reserved words that cannot be used as identifiers - include the keyword and a brief description of its purpose]

1. aynd == AND
2. klase == CLASS
3. others == ELSE
4. cap == FALSE
5. para == FOR
6. fun == FUN
7. ifBro == IF
8. nothing == NULL
9. or == OR
10. writeIt == PRINT
11. goBack == RETURN
12. superIdol == SUPER
13. amoNiSir == THIS
14. trueTrue == TRUE
15. varbs == VAR
16. habangsh == WHILE

Operators

1. (
2. )
3. {
4. }
5. ,

7. -
8. +
9. ;

Literals
[Describe the format and syntax for each type of literal value (e.g., numbers, strings, characters, etc.) your language supports]

Standard format of common languages, nothing special.


Identifiers
[Define the rules for valid identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.) and whether they are case-sensitive]

Function names, class names, and variable names follow 

Comments
[Describe the syntax for comments and whether nested comments are supported]

Our syntax for comments is the same with JAVA.

Syntax Style
[Describe whether whitespace is significant, how statements are terminated, and what delimiters are used for blocks and grouping]

In this language, whitespace such as spaces, tabs, and newlines is generally not significant and serves only to separate tokens or improve readability. Statements are explicitly terminated with a semicolon (;), ensuring clear boundaries between instructions regardless of formatting. Blocks of code are enclosed within curly braces ({ and }), while parentheses (( and )) are used to group expressions or define conditions in control structures. This structure allows the code to remain flexible in terms of layout and indentation while still maintaining strict rules for statement termination and block delimitation.

Sample Code
[Provide a few examples of valid code in your language to demonstrate the syntax and features]

~~~
writeit("Hello World!")

fun add() {
  goback 1 + 1;
}

habangsh (truetrue) {
}
~~~

Design Rationale
[Explain the reasoning behind your design choices]

We want to make an easy language for our conyo gods.
